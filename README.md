# What I hope to learn from INFO 201

- R, obviously. I'm looking forward to having yet **another** programming language under my belt.
- More stuff about Git Bash. I know a little bit, but I'm excited to learn *more*!
- General skills surrounding data visualization. What's the best/worst way to visualize data, different ways to do it, etc.
